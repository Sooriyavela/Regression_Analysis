# ASDS 6301: Final Project

This repository contains the R code and analysis for the ASDS 6301 final project. The project explores the performance of students based on their test preparation courses, gender, and scores in math, reading, and writing.

## Overview

The project analyzes a dataset containing students' academic performance and investigates:
- Correlations among math, reading, and writing scores.
- The effect of test preparation courses on academic performance.
- Differences in scores based on gender.

## Features

### Key Analyses
1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Pairwise correlation plots.
   - Histograms for individual score distributions.
   - Boxplots with jitter for visualizing variable spread.
   
2. **Statistical Summaries**:
   - Summary statistics for math, reading, and writing scores.
   - Total null values in the dataset.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Histograms for score distributions.
   - Scatter plots with regression lines to explore relationships between scores.

4. **Statistical Testing**:
   - Tests like linear regression and pairwise correlations.

### Tools and Libraries
- **Libraries**:
  - `ggplot2` for advanced data visualizations.
  - `reshape2` for data transformation.
  - `lmtest` for statistical testing.
  - `dplyr` for data manipulation.
